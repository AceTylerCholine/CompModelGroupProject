	S1 Table. Personalized result of all 283 subjects used.
	In this table, a score between 0 and 1 is used to define the membership score of each area to the autism class, with 0 being normal and 1 being the highest in the autism class membership. The scores in this table are used to generate the color coded visualization in Fig 6.
